As part of a research project under IIT, we designed a novel 3D printing robotic manipulator with an improved workspace compared to the conventional serial 3D printing robot, the Tripteron. 

The goal was to enhance the effective printable area while maintaining precision and avoiding mechanical interference. To achieve this, we first performed inverse kinematics calculations to determine the possible positions of the robot’s end-effector within the desired workspace. An interference detection algorithm was then developed to identify and eliminate positions where physical obstructions or mechanical limits would prevent safe operation. 

Both the kinematic equations and the interference-check algorithm were compiled into a MATLAB program, which was used to visualize and evaluate the robot’s achievable workspace. The final model and findings were handed over to the university’s robotics research division for further development and experimental validation.
